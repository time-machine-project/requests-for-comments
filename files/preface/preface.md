# Preface

This document summarizes the efforts of the Time Machine _Request for Comments_
effort. It is automatically created from the contents of the TM RFC
repository[^tm_rfc_repo] and published following a loose semi-annual schedule
with additional releases on important milestones. All RFCs are written by the
Time Machine RFC Team and Editorial Committee as well as all individual RFC
authors in a joint effort.
