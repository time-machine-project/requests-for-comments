# Motivation

The process for writing RFCs requires long-term planning instruments which will
enable writers to not only access constantly updated versions of current RFCs
but also to have a view on future planned RFCs. The **RFC Tree** as described in
this RFC will provide an up-to-date description of all planned RFCs, including a
short textual motivation for each and listing their dependencies with other
RFCs.

# Definition

**RFC Tree** is the metaphorical description and the hierarchical representation
of the **Time Machine Request for Comments** development plan that will be used
as a baseline scenario to help monitor the progress and achievements towards
completion of the **Time Machine Horizon** over the coming 10 years.

# Behaviour

While the **RFC Tree** itself results from the progressive completion of RFCs
over time, it also acts as a blueprint for defining the incremental steps used
to build the Time Machine Infrastructure.

**RFC Tree** behaves as a body of law for Time Machine, containing all RFC
documentation and documenting the production process, as well as a progress
indicator showing the progress of upgrades to Time Machine components in real
time.

**RFC Tree** is a macro-architecture plan that shapes dependencies between RFCs.
It could be divided into micro thematic or productive arcs, as each RFC belongs
to a specific sequence and is classified in one of the following categories:
Framework, Infrastructure, Data, Local Time Machines.

Singular RFCs are the basic units of the **RFC Tree**. The 70+ initial RFCs are
listed at the end of this document. This initial set is an indicative path to
completion of the **Time Machine Horizon** and may be expanded/modified/edited
as needed. The tree-like structure and subsequent dependency chains which
connect singular RFC guarantee that the **Time Machine Horizon** will be
realised, as each RFC edit/removal/addition will cause dynamic adjustments and
reorganisation.

This RFC provides the most up-to-date version of the **RFC Tree**.

## RFC-0000 - RFC on RFCs {#rfc-0000}

Reaching consensus on the technology options to pursue in a programme as large
as Time Machine is a complex issue. To ensure open development and evaluation of
work, a process inspired by the Request for Comments (RFC) that was used for the
development of the Internet protocol is being adapted to the needs of Time
Machine. Time Machine Requests for Comments are freely accessible publications,
identified with a unique ID, that constitute the main process for establishing
rules, recommendations and core architectural choices for Time Machine
components.

## RFC-0005 - RFC on Local Time Machines {#rfc-0005}

In order to build a planetary-scale Time Machine, it is necessary to define an
organic incremental strategy. To succeed, the Time Machine must be able to
progressively anchor itself in local territories, bringing added value to local
activities directly, spurring the creation of new projects to mine information
of the past contained in surviving objects and documents. Local Time Machines
(LTM) can be defined as zones of higher density of activities towards
reconstruction of the past. This RFC defines the dynamics that will: enable
bootstrapping of Local Time Machines, facilitate the onboarding of new projects,
valorise the data extracted, facilitate the involvement of the local population,
develop use cases for exploitation avenues, and eventually enable the
development of sustainable structures where Big Data of the Past are fruitfully
exploited thus leading to a constant increase of such activities.

## RFC-0006 - RFC on Technical Charter {#rfc-0006}

The goal of the Technical Charter is to guarantee a first level of
standardisation for data and processes, in order to remain light and usable by
most, and the charter also encourages the use of universal and open interfaces
and references that do not require central coordination

acquisition, sharing and publishing) and to sustain the interoperability and
accessibility of the TM. The proposed solutions could be based on the Creative
Commons copyright licenses and should be further developed with the help of
cultural-heritage networks (e.g. Europeana) who are experienced with these
issues and are already proposing solutions. Means of monitoring the openness
process of data should also be taken into consideration.

organisation further developed. Value scales concerning Projects will be created
based on previously defined bricks and other criteria required in order to
foster the development of Projects (e.g. collaboration, cooperation metrics). As
some of the measures will relate to qualitative processes, a dedicated RFC on
collaboration indicators will focus on creating a suitable system of metrics.

A typology of digitisation interventions will be established grouping:

1. Collections that can be moved and processed in digital hubs (large,
   non-fragile collections), collections or objects that need local intervention
   (e.g. very fragile document, statues, buildings)
2. Processes that can be performed by volunteers using mobile technology (e.g.
   scanning campaign across cities, on-the-fly digitisation in reading rooms),

## RFC-0014 - RFC on Digitisation Priorities and Data Selection {#rfc-0014}

A data selection model based on the identification of performance criteria will
help partners to focus on priority aspects and to take decisions accordingly.
For reference, the National Information Standards Organisation (NISO) has
already proposed a framework for guidance on Building Good Digital Collections.
Examples of performance criteria include: Significance of Content to Internal
Stakeholders (degree to which a collection, once digitised supports the both
immediate and long-term research and the teaching needs of the institution),
Significance of Content to External Stakeholders (a highly successful digital
collection is of interest to researchers and users outside of the university),
Uniqueness (many unique institutional resources such as original photographs,
archival materials, grey literature such as university technical reports and
conference proceedings have not yet been digitised), Exposure (degree to which a
digital collection garners positive recognition and press for an institution and
assessing the potential for digital availability of the collection to result in
grants and other funding). This digitisation recommendation will also be in line
with the LTM coordinated strategy for digitisation.

## RFC-0016 - RFC on Data Lifecycle {#rfc-0016}

The data lifecycle within the TM begins with the concept of documents and data
selection. The goal is to assist partners in selecting proper documents or
collections to be processed by the TM pipelines and then subsequently which data
within the documents. The data selection is closely related to the LTM or
project perimeters (see LTM/Framework) and should be stated prior to any project
launch. Criteria such as intellectual property rights, obtaining copyright
permissions, digitisation, OCR processing or metadata creation costs must also
be taken into account. Extending the results of the **RFC of Digitisation
Priorities and Data selection**, the RFC will also detail data acquisition, data
sharing and data publishing.

## RFC-0018 - RFC on TM Data Graph {#rfc-0018}

The Time Machine **Data Graph** contains all information modelled in the Time
Machine. The graph is constructed both manually and automatically through the
processing of the **Digital Content Processor**. The **Data Graph** is
intrinsically composed of two sub-parts: (1) The bright graph, which is composed
of information that has been manually mapped and integrated with other large
databases or used in a publication. This information is integrated with the
current sum of digital human knowledge. It can be considered actual. (2) The
dark graph, which is composed of information extracted automatically from
(massive) documentation which has to this point been used in a stand alone
fashion as individual historic items. It can be considered virtual.

## RFC-0019 - RFC for TM APIs {#rfc-0019}

Algorithms and software integrated into the Time Machine must be able to
communicate with each other, thus a definition of joint APIs is required. It is
likely that TM Services will be built on top of REST interfaces. In order to
meet TM's needs, these will have to be adapted towards use in large-scale
machine learning. A probable addition is the option to provide the gradient
information of a specific module that is integrated using the API, for example.
This way remote services can also be integrated into large-scale training
processes.

Definition of Time Machine's multilingual strategy. This RFC impacts the
exploitation platforms, as the TM will handle documents in multiple European
languages and dialects. Some of these languages might be more complicated to
address than others due to pre-existing tools for modern variants or
availability of materials. A working plan for natural language processing (NLP)
tool development should be conceived by taking into consideration the materials,
the locations of the LTMs and the Digitisation Hubs, and the features of the
languages.

## RFC-0022 - RFC on Digital Content Processor Development and Testing {#rfc-0022}

Digital Content Processors (DCP) are automatic processes for extracting
information from documents (images, video, sound, etc.) As such, the following
pipeline may be envisioned: (1) Development of a DCP in a dedicated “Sandbox” (a
place where trial and error tests can be undertaken without compromising the
entire functioning of the Time Machine architecture). Training will be done on
existing labelled documents. (2) Submission of the DCP to the Time Machine
Organisation's dedicated service. (3) After some benchmark and assessments of
performance, resulting in acceptance or rejection, the suitable DCP becomes an
Official TM Component.

Defining the functioning and business model for the Digitisation Hubs. In order
for the Digitisation Hubs to be implemented, standards in terms of resolution,
file formats and metadata during acquisition need to be defined beforehand (RFC
on Technical Charts). These standards must be consensual and simple in order to
ensure easy implementation and fit into existing practices. The RFC must also
evaluate relevant technologies and recommend affordable technologies that do not
damage the objects, while also providing the best possible results at the same
time. Time Machine aims to distribute affordable technology on a large scale
using, for example, open design hardware. More costly and dedicated scanning
solutions ,such as scan robots and tomographic methods, should be made available
in specialised centres spread across the European Union such that their services
are available to a maximum number of users. The objective of achieving
affordable and wide-spread digitisation should be a priority in this RFC.

franchise system must be scalable and adaptable, as the network will grow along
with its reputation in the public eye and the financial benefit generated for
LTMs. The franchise system is meant to be complementary to that which is
established for the TMO partners. To enter a LTM, an institution should at
minimum be required to become a member of the TMO. One of the subtasks of this
RFC is to also assess and to further design the role of the TMO as a “Financial,

will be stored on specific servers accessible through standard protocols (e.g.
images on IIIF servers), the aim of the project is to develop a storage solution
that would have the following objectives: (1) Giving access to high volume of
data with high efficiency, (2) Optimising storage to store more data, (3)
Implementing long-term preservation of data, preventing accidental or deliberate
deletion and keeping a fully versioned history of the data stored, (4)

This document will define the infrastructure principles for a decentralized
solution of public datasets based on Creative Commons licences like CC-0, CC-BY,
CC-BY-NC and the Europeana rights declarations. Storage will be maintained for
the resources shared by the partners of the TM Infrastructure Alliance. A
distributed system like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and the work done by
the IPFS Consortium for persistence of IPFS objects may be a good starting
point, as such types of file systems do not identify a resource by its location
but by a unique identification number. Routing algorithms optimised through P2P
algorithms are the most efficient ways to bring the data to the visualisation or
computing processes. This also speeds up the process when the host is a region
with low connectivity. It is critical that redundancy and long-term resilience
can be guaranteed, which means that the system must be designed to make any
public data content that it stores un-deletable in practice. In turn, this will
make it difficult to censor content, and for this reason it is especially well
adapted for public data associated with creative common licenses. Systems like
IPFS also provide the possibility for each node of the network to choose the
categories of data they accept to replicate. This provides some flexibility in
the negotiation of a common strategy by the Time Machine Infrastructure
Alliance. To ensure the authenticity of the data stored, a blockchain type
solution could be the solution. The interaction between the distributed file
system and the authentication solution will be defined by the RFC.

## RFC-0045 - RFC on Distributed Storage System for Private Data {#rfc-0045}

Private datasets could be stored in either: (1) A specific layer of the
distributed storage system, provided reliable cryptographic and authentication
systems are in place, (2) A “fenced” location offered by partners of the Time
Machine Network as storage solution. In both cases, the RFC should define how
such closed datasets could use Time Machine infrastructure services and under
which conditions.

## RFC-0053 - RFC on Large-Scale Inference Engine {#rfc-0053}

The Large-Scale Inference Engine is capable of inferring the consequences of
chaining any information in the database. This enables Time Machine to induce
new logical consequences of existing data. The Large-Scale Inference Engine is
used to shape and to assess the coherence of the 4D simulations based on
human-understandable concepts and constraints. Its origin derives from more
traditional logic-based AI technology, slightly overlooked since the recent
success of the deep learning architecture, that can, nevertheless, play a key
role in an initiative like TM. This document will specify the various types of
rules that the Large-Scale Inference Engine can process including: rules
extracted from documents by DCP, implicit rules made explicit, and rules
(statistical or not) induced from the data. The document should define: the
process by which rules are submitted, tested and integrated in the engine, and
the processes for managing conflicting rules or results from various rules. The
document will also motivate implementation of solutions in relation with
existing deployed systems like Wolfram Alpha or IBM Watson and standards like
OWL, SKOS.

## RFC-0054 - RFC on the 4D Grid {#rfc-0054}

Through a hierarchical division of space (3D) and time, the system organises a
multi-resolution 4D grid which serves as a general spatiotemporal index. Each
“cube” in the grid indexes all the information relevant for these particular
spatiotemporal elements. It offers an efficient perspective for organising large
datasets and performing collective curation through manual and automatic
processes. Each element of the grid will also potentially be labelled according
to other various multidimensional criteria, some of them being AI-based
descriptors (e.g. descriptors for architectural style detection in images).

## RFC-0055 - RFC on 4D Simulations {#rfc-0055}

The 4D grid is sparse, as there are many places/times in the world that are not
directly associated with existing archival data. A central research challenge is
to develop AI systems capable of extending the information of the data grid in
space and time through continuous extrapolation and interpolation, and
developing new ways of visualising which parts of the content are anchored in
sourced data, simulated or unknown. Extensions of current deep-learning
generative methods, originally developed for 2D imaging, can be envisioned to
deal with the richness of the 4D datasets. Many 4D simulations can be associated
with the same 4D grid, and one central challenge is to manage this multiplicity
of worlds and their specific resolution levels for various services of the Time
Machine (e.g. entertainment, policy planning).

## RFC-0058 - RFC on 4D Simulator {#rfc-0058}

The 4D Simulator manages a continuous spatiotemporal simulation of all possible
pasts and futures that are compatible with the data. The 4D Simulator includes a
multi-scale hierarchical architecture for dividing space and time into discrete
volumes with a unique identifier: a simulation engine for producing new datasets
based on the information stored. Each possible spatiotemporal multi-scale
simulation corresponds to a multidimensional representation in the 4D computing
infrastructure. When sufficient spatiotemporal density of data is reached, it
can produce a 3D representation of the place at a chosen moment in European
history. In navigating the representation space, one can also navigate in
alternative past and future simulations. Uncertainty and incoherence are managed
at each stage of the process and directly associated with the corresponding
reconstructions of the past and the future. The document should specify the
interaction of the 4D simulator with the rest of the architecture, answering
questions like: How can an entity of the TM Data Graph be associated with a
particular element of the 4D Grid?, How can 4D simulations be run and cached for
future use?, How can the system be used directly in exploitation platforms?

The Universal Representation Engine manages a multidimensional representation of

of digital cultural artefacts (text, images, videos, 3D and time) and permitting
new types of data generation based on trans-modal pattern understanding. In such
a space, the surface structure of any complex cultural artefact, landscape or
situation is seen as a point in a multidimensional vector space. On this basis,
it could generate a statue or a building or produce a piece of music or a
painting, based only on its description, geographical origins and age. The
document will specify the integration of the URE in the global architecture,
outlining for example how a given node in the TM Data Graph can be associated
with a parametric representation space.
