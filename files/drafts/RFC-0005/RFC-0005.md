# RFC-0005: RFC on LTM

## Motivation

In order to build a planetary scale Time Machine, it is necessary to define an organic incremental strategy. To succeed, the Time Machine must enable to progressively anchor itself in local territories, directly bringing locally higher value to the  activities, favouring the creation of new projects to mine information about the past in surviving objects and documents. 

Local Time Machines can be defined as zones of higher density of activities of past reconstruction. This RFC defines the dynamics that permit to bootstrap Local Time Machines, facilitate onboarding of new projects, valorise the data extracted, facilitate the involvement of the local population, develop use cases for exploitation avenues and eventually find sustainable regime where **Big Data of the Past** are fruitfully exploited leading to a constant increase of such activities. 

## Approach

The general idea is that **Local Time Machines** do not have a hierarchical structure managed by a coordinator or leader, but represent an aggregation of different projects, which arose in different contexts and which have their own indipendent structure and governance, specific purposes, development context and method of financing. Consequently, **Local Time Machines** are area characterised by **Density of Operations**. There is no single coordination that aims to manage all the projects that have arisen in a specific area. All those involved in the various projects and activities, through their organisation charts, can in any case converge towards a community which will therefore have an autonomous logic of structuring and functioning that emerges locally. The projects involved can include project with national and internationl grants, institutional projects having internal funding, projects financed by local administrative institutions, projects hold by companies on cultural heritage benefiting of services and tools implemented by the **Time Machine Organisation** through the **Local Time Machines Infrastructure**, but also small scale projects lead by individuals.

The project-based horizontal structure has key advantages. 

- Standard process facilited easy onboarding facilates of new projects and members and ensure openness by-design

- Standard operations guaranty by design the desired level of compatibillity between processes and datasets. 

- Centralized repositories for projects, operations and data sets enable an constantly up-to-date map of activities in progress.

*Some key benefits in development of the Time Machine Organisation in designing an horizontal structure*
*The growth in membership including new members and new research activities. app*

*Manage a centralized system for cartographying  all the Local activities in progress and to directly monitor, on a centralized level, the evolution of the projects, compliance with ethical norms and standards, proposed and approved by the community.*

*Another fundamental requirement of the Time Machine Organisation is to have a precise cartography of all the Local activities in progress and to directly monitor, on a centralised level, the evolution of the projects, compliance with ethical norms and standards, proposed and approved by the community.*

## Definition of Terms

###  Component 

A Component of the Time Machine is itselt a Machine in the sense of systems reacting in a predictable manner to input given an internal State. Each component can react or be acted upon through a defined set of Inputs / Operations. Some of these operations can internal, others can be external. 

###  Internal and External Operations of a Component 

Internal Operations change the internal structure or state of an Entity and therefore update its history. 

Input x State -> Next State 

External Operations change characterises the usage of a Component, producing an external Output on the Bases of the current State of the Machine. 

Input x State -> Output

###  History of a Component 

Sequence of consecutive states. 

## Definition of Core Components

###  4D Map

The **4D Map** is one of the central component of Time Machine. It plots both on-going projects and the dataset of these projects. This means that the  **4D Map**  is both the map where activities can be followed and the map that aggregates results. The density of the **4D Map** is not uniformed. In particular some zones may be modelled only in 3D, 2D and even 1D, as a list of included elements. The **4D Map** includes a layer of **GeoEntities** on which **Local Time Machines** can be anchored. The **4D Map** can be navigated using the several **4D interfaces**

Examples of Internal Operations 

- Addition of a new Local Time Machine on a **GeoEntity** of the **4D Map**.  
- Registration of an **Event** on the **4D Map**


###  4D Navigator Interfaces

The 4D interfaces can be application-based or web-based. They can be for desktop or mobile. By default, the mobile version may not feature more of the project editing tools. 

Examples of External Operations 

- Navigate in Space and see activities of **Local Time Machines**
- Navigate in Space and Time to see the State of the 4D reconstruction

###  Projects

Projects are usually conducted by institutions but can also be launched by individuals. Projects may be new or redocumentation of ancient projects. A project can be considered a component of the Time Machine, and therefore be characterised by a specific **History**. 

Projects can mine **Sources** and ingest their extracted data into the **Data Graph** using the **Local Time Machine Tools** and **Local Time Machine API** These Projects are associate with a **Zone of Coverage** that associated them with **Local Time Machines**. Theses projects produce data for a particular **Place** or several **Places**.  

Projects can also develop **Prototype Tools** that may become official Local Time Machine tools at a later stage. These tools are usually tested on local datasets and therefore associated with a a **Zone of Coverage**

Projects can also develop **Use Cases**, like example of interface to navigate the data, application in certain exploitaiton areas, etc.

###  Zone of Coverage

The **Zone of Coverage** of a **Project** or a **Use Case** is defined as section of the **4D Map**.
The intersection of the **Zone of Coverage** and the **Time Machine GeoEntities** defines the **GeoEntities** covered by the Project. The **Zone of Coverage** may also definie a **Temporal Slice**. The **Zone of Coverage** can be defined using the **4D interfaces**. 

The **Zone of Coverage** can be defined searching a place in the list of **Time Machine GeoEntities** and choising it on the map. This is the case of cities or entities already existing in the GeoEntities list. 

The **Zone of Coverage** can also defined with an inclusive criterion for example by selecting multiple entities already existing on the card. This is the case of many cities or more in general places already existing in the GeoEntities list. 

The **Zone of Coverage** may also correspond to a larger territory. In this case the system detects the coverage area as a set of all GeoEntities represented within this polygon. In the consultation mode, only the **Time Machine GeoEntities**  included in the polygon of the project will be shown on the map.

*here figure of three cases*

### Time Machine GeoEntities

Fixed list of entities that defines the list of potential **Local Time Machines**. The list is based on existing geographical entities (OSM-GOOGLE t.b.d.) consisting in points - lines - polygons. 

**Time Machine GeoEntities** can also be added as the geometric format of points. This in cases where the **Zone of Coverage** does not include the element being studied. 

In **Version A** we expect to be able to add only new points to insert new  **Time Machine GeoEntities** in the case in which entities not yet existing in the list. In later versions would be important have an editing mode in which you can also draw different geometries (polygons-lines) for specifying shape of different entities. In later versions it will also be possible to make new **Time Machine GeoEntities** even more granular within an already existing entity. This is the case of projects inserted in a city which, however, study only one particular point or a geographical 'subset' of objects present in the city.







###  Project Development Space

The **Project Development Space** is a space in the Time Machine Website that features an increasing number of tools to extract information from **Sources**, develop ""Use Cases**, etc. 


###  Local Time Machine

A **Local Time Machine** is defined as the activities and results of the **Projects** happening in a **Place**

It is associated with a **Local Time Machine Activities** and **Local Time Machine Community**

The activities and results are presented in the **Local Time Machine Webspace**

###  Local Time Machine Operations

The **Local Time Machine Operations** are the list of basic operations produced by **Projects** and concerning particular **GeoEntitites**. They appear as log of activies in the **Local Time Machines Webspace**. 

###  Local Time Machine Density of Operations

The **Local Time Machine Densitiy of Operations** characterises the amounty of activities going on in the **Local Time Machine**. 

###  Local Time Machine Community

The **Local Time Machine Community** is the list of active users that would like to get updated about annoucement concerrning **Local Time Machine Activitites**

###  Local Time Machine Webspace 

The **Local Time Webspace** features the information of all the **Projects** linked with the **Places** corresponding to the **Local Time Machine**


## Phases of Development of the LTM Infrastructure

Each cities wich corresponds to a **Local Time Machine** (i.e. each city which have a **Project** activitily working on it) would be highlighted. By clicking of corresponding city, the user access the **Local Time Machine WebSpace**. The interface should give access to the General Menu permitting to create a new project. 
2. Project Editors including basic tools for editing

## Principles of Development

### Memory Store

Each document, artefact or building is a memory store, a kind of "hard-drive" from the past. The Tools for the Local Time Machine are extraction tools to redocument the content of these memory stores into the **Data Graph**. 


### Retrochronological order

The principle that consists of starting from the present and going back to the past, retroprogating through transfer the presicion of the present 

### Information Skeleton

The information sketelon should contains a complete divison of a place for a given year. 
This includes all the pathways and all the parcels. 

### Semi-completness

Achievement for  **Place** of a good coverage of the Information Skeleton 

### Transfer

Transfer of a structure of given year to the the year before assuming no change have occured. Linked with the principle of continuity. If transfer of a given **Place**  is not impossible, its means that an event occured. This event must be modeled in order to push the information backward. 


### Frontier year

Oldest date in the past for which the information skeleton of the **Place** is semi-complete. 

### Scouting Projects

Project beyond the Frontiers year

## Examples of Processes

### Example : Museum creating a project

To enter and curate data in the **Data Graph**, a Museum will create a project, possibly jointly with other institutions, with a particular spatio-temporal anchoring objective. For simplicity of the explanation, let’s assume the collection to be ingested is already digitized. The steps are the following:

1- The Museum defines the approximate **Zone of Coverage** of the collection. This will defines the **Places** (and therefore the **Local Time Machines**) for which the data will be relevant. It can be updated later. 

2- The Museum enters the repository where the **Source** collection is, typically as a IIIF repository. If the Museum does not have an IIIF solution, a physical or virtual **Time Machine Box** can be used. The data will remain in the chosen repository unless the Museum wants to benefit from a long-term preservation service. 

3- Using the **Tools**, the project partners reposition the objects of the chosen collection in space and time (for instance annotating content of paintings or documenting the steps in the trajectory of the objects)

4- As all operations are logged in the **Time Machine Operation Graph**, a synchronisation tools is capable of informing of any conflict in the metadata inserted linked to other operations of the Time Machine (for instance due to an inference or a non compatible entree). On this basis, the Museum may or may not update its metadata or launch specific research initiatives to investigate further the conflicting data elements. 

This case is a simple one. More complex curation may occur.

## Use Cases

## Services to LTM

### Digitisation Hubs

The **Digitisation Hubs** are an example of service that will be offered to Local Time Machines  for digitisation (e.g. scanning of documents, streets, 3D scanning). 

The **Digitisation Hubs** will enable to seamlessly aggregated new document and metadata into a **Data Graph**, with the appropriate standards in terms of resolution, file formats, and metadata during acquisition. Contractual aspects will be dealt with the Time Machine Standard Contracts. 

The Structure and detailed functioning of the Digitisation Hubs are planned to be developed first as an RFC specifying their structure then implemented as a Service operated by several operators. As planned in the RFC Tree and roadmaps, The RFC on Digitisation Hubs is planned on Y2 and their first implementation on Y3 and Y4. It will be established directly with actors that may become Service operators. 

What is anticipated are the following steps :

a) Declaration of the digitisation Services on timemachine.eu

b) Specification of its **Zone of Coverage**. The **Zone of Coverage** will determine the Local Time Machines in which the Services will be publicized. 

c) Precise definition of digitisation offers using only **Standard Metrics** in order to be able to determine the exact price of the operations 

d) Once the service are ready, direct transaction on the Timemachine.eu platform

This way of functioning should enable to create a well-functioning single European market for digitisation services connecting operators and costumers using agreed standards. 

### Long-term Preservation

Likewise, some operators may offer services for the long-term preservation of particular datasets (e.g. IIIF repository). This can for instance include DNA storage.
