# Motivation

The Time Machine Project Scouting Service aims to support Time Machine Organisation (TMO) members in the process of forming competitive project consortia and submitting high-quality project proposals relevant third-party funding schemes. The Project Scouting Service provides support in pre-proposal and networking areas. This will ultimately not only fortify the efforts of TMO members and their consortia but even more importantly enhance their chances at success in receiving funding.


# Description

The Time Machine **Project Scouting Service** is a service offered exclusively to **Time Machine Organisation** (TMO) members (RFC-0069). This Service enables members of the Time Machine network to have access to relevant third-party funding sources.

Time Machine members benefit from tailored services provided by the Project Scouting team such as the identification of relevant calls for proposals and supporting the search for possible partners or capable project consortia from within the Time Machine network.

The Time Machine Project Scouting Service is a free-of-charge service for founding and regular members of the Time Machine Organisation.

# Benefits for TMO members

The Project Scouting team is a one-stop-shop assistant for funding schemes. The Service provides a wide range of specialised services ranging from the initial identification of suitable calls to the connection of potential partners and consortia.

This way, Time Machine members receive access to funding resources, internal and external research as well as innovation skills. Furthermore, the Service enables enhanced partnerships and collaborations for greater research and innovation achievements. Finally, the Project Scouting Service paves the way for uptake of research results generated by joint efforts of the Time Machine Organisation and its members.

# Services for TMO members

1. Pre-proposal Support Services
- Identification of relevant calls and funding schemes for research and innovation fields matching the objectives and scope of Time Machine
- Identification of possible collaborators (European research and innovation actors, projects and initiatives) for targeted calls
2. Networking Support
- Organisation of partnering meetings, networking and brokerage events as well as call/project-based workshops for selected calls
- Networking and matchmaking tool for members of the TMO to help forming project consortia and apply for funding

# Participation Scheme

Time Machine members are given the opportunity to cooperate with the Time Machine Organisation (TMO) in proposals targeted at calls within the research and innovation objectives and scope of Time Machine.

The Time Machine Organisation may collaborate in various ways. Either with a Letter of Interest (LoI), by being a direct consortium partner or by acting as project coordinator. In this context, the transparent setting of rules and conditions of participation as well as the collaboration process by the Time Machine Organisation is guaranteed.

A project proposal is eligible to receive support by the Project Scouting Service if:
- The proposal is coordinated by a TMO member
- The proposal targets a relevant third-party funding opportunity
- The proposal conforms to the principles of the TMO, its vision and scope and contributes to the objectives of Time Machine (RFC-0069, RFC-0007, RFC-0002)

## Participation Case 1: TMO Cooperates with Letters of Interest (LOI)

The Time Machine Organisation supports project applications of its members with a LoI if:
- The proposed project is only using free-of-charge Time Machine services (e.g. project presentation on Time Machine platforms, inclusion of the project in the Time Machine project portfolio, application of public Time Machine tools within the project)
- The proposed project conforms to the Time Machine principles, its vision and scope and contributes to the overall realisation of Time Machine objectives

## Participation Case 2: TMO as Consortium Partner

The Time Machine Organisation may join a consortium as a partner if:
- The proposed project applies Time Machine services (e.g. TMO manages the project´s dissemination tasks and community brokerage/endorsement, project sustainability is secured by integrating it´s tools into the TMO tool set)
- TMO may deliver services for the proposed project itself or may contract partners with a handling fee
- The proposed project conforms to the Time Machine principles, its vision and scope and contributes to the overall realisation of Time Machine objectives

## Participation Case 3: TMO Coordinates Project Proposals

The Time Machine Organisation collaborates with its members in project applications that are of central interest to the Organisation. Applications of interest may be driven by the Time Machine Organisation as project coordinator if: 
- The proposed project in line with the overall principles of Time Machine
- The proposed project conforms to the Time Machine principles, its vision and scope and contributes strategically to the overall realisation of Time Machine objectives

## Participation Case 4: TMO members receive support for their applications

Members of the Time Machine Organisation are eligible to receive support in their efforts to prepare and submit project proposals even if the TMO does not directly participate in or support the application in question. Nonetheless, the following objectives must be met by the project proposal:
- The proposed project in line with the overall principles of Time Machine
- The proposed project conforms to the Time Machine principles, its vision and scope and contributes strategically to the overall realisation of Time Machine objectives
