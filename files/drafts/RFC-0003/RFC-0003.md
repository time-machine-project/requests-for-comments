# Motivation

This file is the template to be used for new RFCs. It is intended to be both a starting point for new RFCs and an example of what can be achieved within the limits of a markdown file.

# File structure

## YAML-Header

To aid the generation of the final release-PDF-files, this Markdown file contains a header in the `YAML`-format[^yaml]. Apart from other things it states the RFC-title and subtitle as well as information about the authors of the RFC.

Please keep the header exactly as-is, its contents will be modified by the RFC-Editorial Team.

## Sections

An RFC document should always contain the YAML header, a *Motivation* section directly below the header as the first section in the document, as many author-defined sections as necessary as the main content, a *questions and answers*-section (*Q&A*) and the footnotes at the bottom of the document. Writers can delete the pre-existing section structure (with the exception of the motivation and q&a sections) in this file and add new sections as they see fit.

The *Motivation* section is intended to show the general reason for the writing of the RFC. It should be concise.

The *Q&A* section is intended to provide a view on the RFC from a different angle than the one of a traditional paper on a subject. It gives RFC writers the possibility to test their main structures, methods and drawbacks from the point of view of outside readers of the document. It should follow the general form outlined below in the q&a section of this template file.

# TM Glossary

Terms that are of special significance to the Time Machine must be written in **bold** on their first usage in an RFC document. Definitions and important terms are listed in *RFC-0001 on RFC Glossary*.

# Markdown

It is allowed to use the whole range of Markdown features as well as everything supported by Pandoc out of the box. A good overview and introduction can be found in the Markdown specification itself[^daring_markdown] and the Pandoc user documentation[^pandoc_markdown].

## Hyperlinks

RFCs are released as PDF documents. While it is possible to set hyperlinks in Markdown that will also work in PDF documents it is advised to add the actual links in footnotes. This way they can be easily read.  Footnotes (similar to the one in the previous paragraph can be created by adding `[^footnote_name]` where the footnote is to be placed and `[^footnote_name]: Content of the footnote` at the end of this file. Only alphanumeric characters and underscores are allowed. Hyperlinks in footnotes should be added in angled brackets: `<http://example.com>`.

## Tables

It is possible to use the different ways to create table using Pandoc markdown[^pandoc_tables]. The following example uses the simple syntax:

  Right     Left     Center     Default
-------     ------ ----------   -------
     12     12        12            12
    123     123       123          123
      1     1          1             1

## Images

It is possible to include images. They should be added in an `images` folder directly next to the markdown document. In the text they are referenced like this: `![Image caption](./images/image_name_including_file_ending.png)`. The path is relative to the location of the Markdown file.

## Diagrams

In addition to pre-created images, it is also possible to add so-called *Mermaid*[^mermaid] diagrams and flowcharts to the document. This are two examples:

```mermaid
graph LR
    draft[RFC Draft] --> candidate[RFC Candidate] --> draft
    candidate --> release{RFC release}
    release -.updates on existing RFCs.-> draft
```

```mermaid
pie
    title Time spent on RFCs
    "Preparation" : 10
    "Draft" : 60
    "Release Candidate" : 30
```

# Q&A

## Question: Am I allowed to modify the YAML header on top of the file?

No, the header is aimed at the creation of the release PDF files and should only be changed by the RFC-Editorial Team.

## Question: Can I omit the Motivation or Q&A sections?

No, both sections are important for reviewers and implementers to understand the direction of the RFC, it's motivation and possibly problematic points / implications for other parts of the Time Machine.

## Question: Why doesn't my file look the same in my editor, the GitHub repository and the PDF files?

The PDF files are created by an automated process using *Pandoc*[^pandoc], a tool to convert between different text formats. It provides more extensive capabilities for text structuring and formatting (for instance footnotes). This additional parts are not understood by the GitHub Markdown parser and might be previewed differently by various markdown editors.

## Question: Where can I preview how my RFC document will look at the end?

If you have started your document by forking the official GitHub RFC repository[^rfc_repo] you can see the current version of the RFC drafts in the *Action* section of your own GitHub RFC repository[^github_manage_action] after you pushed a change to it.
